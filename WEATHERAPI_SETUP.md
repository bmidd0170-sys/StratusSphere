# WeatherAPI.com Integration Setup

## Overview
StratusSphere now uses **weatherapi.com** for real-time weather forecasts (current conditions, hourly, and daily forecasts). ChatGPT handles all other AI-powered features (weather suggestions, outfit recommendations, scheduling).

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```bash

VITE_WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_weatherapi_key_here
```

#### Option B: Using `.env` (For Production)

```bash
VITE_WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_weatherapi_key_here
```

### 3. Verify the Setup

    ]
  }
}
```

## Code Integration

The integration replaces the Open-Meteo API calls with weatherapi.com in:

### File: `src/hooks/useWeatherChat.js`

**New Function**: `fetchWeatherFromWeatherAPI(city)`
- Replaces `fetchRealTimeWeather(city)`
- Calls: `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json`
- Returns standardized weather data object

**Updated Functions**:
- `getWeatherForCity(city)` - Now uses weatherapi.com
- `sendChatMessageWithCity(userMessage, conversationHistory, overrideCity)` - Pulls forecast from weatherapi.com

### Changes from Open-Meteo:
- ✅ No geocoding step needed (weatherapi.com handles city names directly)
- ✅ Simpler API call (single endpoint instead of two)
- ✅ Faster response times
- ✅ More detailed weather icons
- ✅ Better condition descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "VITE_WEATHERAPI_KEY is not defined"

**Solution**: Make sure your `.env.local` file is in the root directory and contains:
```
VITE_WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

Restart the dev server after adding the env variable.

### Error: "Weather data not available"

**Solution**: 
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your remaining API calls at https://www.weatherapi.com/my/account.jsp
- Ensure the city name is valid (try a major city like "London" or "Tokyo")

### Missing Forecast Data

**Solution**: The API might be returning incomplete data. Check:
- Browser Console for API response errors
- That you're requesting a valid forecast day (current day to +10 days)
- Your API key has forecast access enabled

## Features Supported by ChatGPT

ChatGPT still handles:
- ✅ Weather-based outfit recommendations
- ✅ Activity suggestions based on forecast
- ✅ Personalized weather advice
- ✅ Schedule creation and management
- ✅ Natural language processing
- ✅ City slang recognition (NYC → New York, etc.)
