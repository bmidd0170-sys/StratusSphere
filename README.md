# ☁️ StratusSphere

**Real-Time Weather, Reimagined.**

StratusSphere is a responsive and visually engaging weather web application built with React to make climate data feel dynamic, personal, and accessible. It provides accurate forecasts, smooth transitions, and interactive visuals that adapt to user input and changing weather conditions. Designed for clarity and immersion, StratusSphere transforms traditional weather tracking into an experience that blends information with atmosphere.

## 🌦️ Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays up-to-date conditions powered by free weather APIs (Open-Meteo or WeatherAPI)
- **Interactive Search**: Look up weather details by city with instant updates on temperature, conditions, and forecasts
- **Dynamic Icons & Backgrounds**: Visuals adjust based on weather type (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.) for immersion
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile with seamless performance across all devices
- **Smooth UI Experience**: Intuitive layouts and animated hover effects enhance usability and flow
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend server required — all logic runs in the browser

## 🧠 Project Goals

StratusSphere was developed to:

- Explore the integration of front-end design with live APIs
- Demonstrate React-based interactivity and state management
- Deliver an app experience that's both functional and visually appealing
- Encourage collaborative problem-solving in a real-world development setting
- Build a polished, presentation-ready product

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Styling**: CSS modules + CSS variables for theme management
- **Data Source**: Open-Meteo or WeatherAPI (free, no backend required)
- **Version Control**: GitHub / Git
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify

## 📂 Project Structure

```
/src
 ├── /components    → Reusable UI parts (WeatherCard, SearchBar, etc.)
 ├── /pages         → Main layout screens (Home, Forecast)
 ├── /hooks         → Custom React hooks (useWeatherData)
 ├── /styles        → CSS modules and global theme
 ├── /assets        → Images, icons, and media
 └── App.jsx        → Root component
```

## 🖼️ UI Overview

The interface features:

- A central weather display showing current temperature, condition, and location
- A search bar for quick city lookups with error handling
- Weather cards with animated hover states and dynamic styling
- Color palettes inspired by natural sky gradients and storm tones
- Mobile-responsive layouts that maintain visual hierarchy

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Multi-day forecasts with visual trend graphs
- Dark/light mode toggle

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/StratusSphere.git
cd StratusSphere
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Open in browser:
Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## 📋 Development Guidelines

Refer to [COPILOTINSTRUCTIONS.md](./COPILOTINSTRUCTIONS.md) for:

- React best practices and Hooks usage
- Naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase, ALL_CAPS)
- Error handling and API integration patterns
- Code quality and testing standards
- Styling organization and responsive design

## 🎨 Coding Standards

- **Components**: Use functional components with React Hooks
- **State**: Manage with `useState`, `useContext`, and custom hooks
- **API Calls**: Use `async/await` with proper error handling
- **Styling**: CSS modules or component-specific CSS files
- **Comments**: Add inline comments for complex logic; remove console.log() before committing
- **File Names**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
