## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# OpenAI API Key - Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here

# WeatherAPI.com Key - Get from https://www.weatherapi.com/
# Free tier: 1 million calls/month, 10-day forecast, hourly data
VITE_WEATHERAPI_KEY=your-key-here

# Unsplash API Key - Get from https://unsplash.com/developers
# (Optional - falls back to generic outfit image if missing)
VITE_UNSPLASH_KEY=your-key-here
```

**See [WEATHERAPI_SETUP.md](./WEATHERAPI_SETUP.md) for detailed WeatherAPI.com setup instructions.**

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 📖 How It Works

### Weather Forecasting
1. User enters a city or asks about weather
2. SearchBar detects location input and converts to weather query
3. App calls WeatherAPI.com for real-time data
4. Forecast displays as interactive cards and hourly charts

### AI Assistance
1. User asks for schedule, outfit, or activity recommendations
2. ChatGPT receives real-time weather context from WeatherAPI.com
3. AI generates personalized suggestions (weather notes, outfits, activities)
4. For schedules: Each item auto-generates weather + outfit suggestions + images

### Smart Schedules
1. User asks AI to create a schedule (e.g., "Plan my day in NYC")
2. AI generates schedule structure with times and activities
3. For each item: Weather and outfit are auto-generated from WeatherAPI.com data
4. Outfit images fetch from Unsplash
5. User can edit, reorder, or delete items in the interactive editor

- Verify WeatherAPI.com key is correct and in `.env.local`
- Try a major city name (e.g., "London", "Tokyo")

### AI responses are slow?
- OpenAI API might be under load
- Check your API key has sufficient credits
- Weather context fetching might be slow (check network tab)

### Outfit images not showing?
- Falls back to generic image if Unsplash API not configured
- Add `VITE_UNSPLASH_KEY` to `.env.local` for custom images
- Check browser console for image fetch errors
